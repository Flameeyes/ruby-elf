This is message from the package's main author and maintainer,
Diego Elio Pettenò, aka "Flameeyes".

If you fell like donating to me for my work on this software, please
consider an alternative first.

During Summer 2007 I was hospitalised for an acute pancreatitis, and
risked my life because of that, as of December 2008 my nightmare might
not be ended just yet, after two more hospitalisations and a few
visits to the ER. As the underlying causes of all this are still
unknown, I would appreciate if any sum you'd have donated to me could
be donated, instead, to one of the following organisation:

- Fondazione Italiana per la ricerca sulle Malattie del Pancreas -
  ONLUS (http://www.fimpancreas.org/) [FIMP]

  Donations can be directed to these IBANs:
    IT 70 J 02008 11709 000040424060
    IT 03 N 05188 11701 000000164768

  In Italy you can donate 5‰ using this "Codice Fiscale" (in your
  "Dichiarazione dei Redditi"):
  
    93175800239

- National Pancreas Foundation (http://www.pancreasfoundation.org/)
  [NPF]
  If you wish to let me know of your support, then choose for a
  Donation in Honor, and use this address:

    Diego Elio Pettenò
    Via Scaramuzza, 125

    Italy

Thank you for reading this document, and thanks to all the people
willing to donate.

If you know other foundations, donations to which could be deduced
from taxes in other countries, feel free to suggest more by mailing me
at flameeyes@gmail.com . Hopefully wherever the research is based, the
improvements will come equally.
