This is message from the package's main author and maintainer, Diego
"Flameeyes" Pettenò.

If you fell like donating to me for my work on this software, please
consider an alternative first.

During Summer 2007 I was hospitalised for 42 days for an acute
pancreatitis, and risked my life because of that. As the causes of
that are still unknown, I would appreciate if any sum you'd have
donated to me could be donated, instead, to one of the following
organisation:

- Fondazione Italiana per la ricerca sulle Malattie del Pancreas -
  ONLUS (http://www.fimpancreas.org/) [FIMP]

  Donations can be directed to these IBANs:
    IT 70 J 02008 11709 000040424060
    IT 03 N 05188 11701 000000164768

  In Italy you can donate 5‰ using this "Codice Fiscale" (in your
  "Dichiarazione dei Redditi"):
  
    93175800239

- National Pancreas Foundation (http://www.pancreasfoundation.org/)
  [NPF]
  If you wish to let me know of your support, then choose for a
  Donation in Honor, and use this address:

    Diego Pettenò
    Via Scaramuzza, 125
    30174 Mestre, VE
    Italy

Thank you for reading this document, and thanks to all the people
willing to donate.

If you know other foundations, donations to which could be deduced
from taxes in other countries, feel free to suggest more by mailing me
at flameeyes@gmail.com . Hopefully wherever the research is based, the
improvements will come equally.
