This is message from the package's main author and maintainer, Diego
"Flameeyes" Pettenò.

If you fell like donating to me for my work on this software, please
consider an alternative first.

During Summer 2006 I was hospitalised for 42 days for an acute
pancreatitis, and risked my life because of that. As the causes of
that are still unknown, I would appreciate if any sum you'd have
donated to me could be donated, instead, to the National Pancreas
Foundation (http://www.pancreasfoundation.org/).

If you wish to let me know of your support, then choose for a Donation
in Honor, and use this address:

  Diego Pettenò
  Via Scaramuzza, 125
  30174 Mestre, VE
  Italy

Thank you for reading this document, and thanks to all the people
willing to donate.
